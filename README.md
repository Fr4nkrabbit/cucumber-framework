# cucumber-framework
First look at Selenium and Cucumber BDD testing automation.

  Going to probably nuke this repo and try a different approach. I think somewhere along the lines I messed up my dependencies and it's going to take longer to figure out where I messed up than just starting fresh.~~

  Fixed my issue
    Needed to have my project in the test directory, not the java directory. Junit is only visible to the test directories.

  First Feature Run
    Ran my first real test using Selenium code to automate a login into StackOverflow.
    
    Can show: 
      * How to run multiple Feature tests at once.
      * Reports that are generated after a run.
      * How Cucumber and Selenium integrate together
      * How Cucumber goes through Selenium code and runs through the automated scenario.
